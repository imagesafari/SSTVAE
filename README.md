# SSTVAE

**Send pictures over HF radio using a neural image codec instead of scanlines or file bytes.**

SSTVAE is an experimental amateur-radio image mode. A convolutional
autoencoder compresses your image into a few hundred thousand
*continuous-valued* numbers ("latents"), and those numbers are sent
directly as OFDM carrier amplitudes — no bits, no packets, no JPEG. The
decoder network is trained with a simulated HF channel in the loop, so
noise and fading push the picture quality gently downhill instead of
breaking it.

It is directly inspired by [FreeDV RADE](https://freedv.org/radio-autoencoder/)
(the "radio autoencoder"), which does the same trick for speech.

**Actually over the air.** Mode B (64 s) on 20 m, transmitted from New
Jersey. Top row received at the
[Northern Utah WebSDR](http://www.sdrutah.org/) in Corinne, Utah —
**3150 km**. Bottom row received in Minnesota — **1700 km**. In both,
the middle panel is 100 W and the right panel is **10 W**, sent back to
back over the same path. One tenth the power costs about 1 dB of
picture: it gets slightly softer rather than breaking up, which is the
whole idea.

> - **The on-air format is not frozen.** Expect incompatible changes.
>   Two stations must run the same commit *and* the same model
>   checkpoint to talk to each other.
> - **There is no release download yet** — the builds aren't code-signed,

## What makes it different

**Analog SSTV** fails softly — noise looks like noise — but QRM tears a
band across the image, lost sync slants the frame, and tuning in late
means the top of the picture is simply gone.

**HamDRM** and **SSDV** send a compressed file. While the FEC holds, the
picture is pixel-perfect; when it doesn't, you lose whole blocks or the
image outright. That's the digital cliff: excellent, excellent,
excellent, nothing.

SSTVAE aims at the middle. Latents are real numbers, so channel noise
adds to them instead of corrupting a bitstream — there's no threshold to
fall off. And a fixed interleaver scatters every frame's latents across
the whole picture, so losing part of a transmission dims detail
*everywhere* slightly rather than removing a region.

![SSTVAE mode B and analog Scottie 2 received over the same path](docs/images/ota-vs-analog.png)

The same picture between the same two stations, on the same frequency,
100 W both, a few minutes apart — and comparable airtime, 64 s against
71 s. The analog copy shows what the channel did to it: impulse noise as
coloured streaks, speckle through the sky, softened detail. The SSTVAE
copy absorbed the same channel into a slightly softer picture. (One
comparison on one path at one moment isn't a controlled study, and
Scottie 2 is 320×256 *by design* — it isn't failing, it's doing its job
at its own resolution.)

Three modes, **32 / 64 / 95 s**, in **~1200 Hz**, at 640×480 — the same
airtime and bandwidth as the common analog modes. Across the range where
acquisition is reliable, 20 dB down to 3 dB SNR, the picture gives up
just **1.4 dB of PSNR for a 17 dB drop in channel SNR**. That gentle
slope is the entire point of the design. The cliff hasn't been abolished
so much as moved off the picture and onto acquisition: below about 0 dB
you increasingly get *no* picture rather than a poor one — which is a
much better place for it.

Two things it costs you:

**You need the model.** The network *is* the codec, so both stations
need the same ~40 MB checkpoint — an interoperability cost analog SSTV
doesn't have. It's fetched automatically on first use.

**It's a reconstruction, not a photograph.** The decoder produces the
most plausible image consistent with the latents that arrived. Fine
detail, small text especially, can come back subtly wrong rather than
merely blurry — and it looks confident either way. Judge it by how the
pictures look, not the pixel count, and don't use it where exactness
matters.

## Get the app

**Most people want the desktop app.** It transmits, receives, keys the
rig and remembers how it is set up, and it needs no Python at all. It's
a native C++/Qt program, built for **Linux x86-64, Linux arm64, macOS
(Apple Silicon and Intel) and Windows x64** on every push, as both a
portable archive and a platform installer (AppImage, `.dmg`, NSIS
setup).

> **No releases page yet.** The builds are not code-signed, so until
> that is sorted out the only downloads are CI artifacts, and GitHub
> requires you to be logged in to fetch them. Open the latest green run
> of [the CI
> workflow](https://github.com/arodland/SSTVAE/actions/workflows/ci.yml),
> scroll to **Artifacts**, and take the one matching your platform
> (`sstvae-linux-x86_64`, `sstvae-macos-arm64`,
> `sstvae-windows-x64-portable`, …) or its installer. macOS and Windows
> will warn you that the app is from an unidentified developer, because
> it is — that is the same missing signature.

The published model is fetched on first use and cached, so there is
nothing else to download. Building from source is an ordinary CMake +
Qt 6 build — see
[Development](https://github.com/arodland/SSTVAE/wiki/Development).

## Using it

One window that transmits and receives on a soundcard, keys the rig, and
remembers how it is set up.

- **Receive** — waterfall with the SSTVAE band marked and an input level
  meter, the picture building up as it arrives, autosave or a Save
  button. Filenames follow a template, e.g.
  `2026-07-26_011542Z_14.340MHz_N0CALL.png`; the frequency comes from
  the rig and is simply left out when there is no rig control.
- **Transmit** — pick a picture, then drag station text and an inset of
  the last received image onto it. The preview *is* the render, so what
  you arrange is exactly what goes on the air. Mode A/B/C with their
  durations, a progress bar, and Cancel.
- **Rig control** — PTT and frequency readback through Hamlib, which is
  bundled, so there is nothing to install. Receive pauses while you
  transmit, so your own signal is never decoded back as a reception.
  Optional: leave it off and use VOX or manual PTT.

Route receiver audio to the computer however you normally would for
digital modes — a rig interface, a VAC/VB-Cable loopback, a
`pulse`/PipeWire monitor source, or just a microphone near the speaker.

<summary>Rig control setup</summary>

Settings → Rig control is modelled on WSJT-X's Radio tab, because that
is the set of knobs a real radio needs and the one you already know:
serial port and baud, data/stop bits, parity, handshake, forced DTR/RTS,
PTT method (VOX/CAT/DTR/RTS) with its own port, and an optional
USB/PKT-USB mode on connect. Everything defaults to **Default**, which
means *leave the backend's own value alone* rather than forcing one.

The **Rig model** box lists every backend the bundled Hamlib supports —
start typing any part of the name (`FT-847`, `IC-7300`) to find it — so
you never look a number up by hand. **Test CAT** and **Test PTT** try
the settings in front of you before you close the dialog.

Two programs cannot both hold the serial port, so sharing a radio means
putting something in front of it that both can talk to — a `rigctld`
from your own Hamlib install, or flrig. Point every program at that
(WSJT-X calls it *Hamlib NET rigctl*; fldigi has flrig built in), and
point this one at it too: model **2 (NET rigctl)** with the daemon's
`host:port` as the device, or model **4 (FLRig)**. They are ordinary
entries in the same picker, so no separate setting is involved. Model
**1** is the dummy rig, handy for exercising the buttons with no radio
attached.

<summary>Transmit-time latent optimization</summary>

Settings → Transmit has one switch, **Optimize latents before
transmitting**. The encoder is amortized — trained to do well on
everything — so for any *one* picture there are better inputs to the
same decoder, and a short gradient descent finds them. Worth
**1.4–1.8 dB** of recovered picture, and it is entirely sender-side:
optimized latents are ordinary latents, so the receiving station needs
no change and does not need to know.

It runs speculatively, starting a moment after you stop editing, so the
cost lands in time you were spending anyway; hitting Send early just
takes the best result so far. See
[docs/latent-optimization.md](docs/latent-optimization.md).

## Credits

The radio-autoencoder concept, the two-stage training recipe and the
PAPR-penalty approach all come from **FreeDV RADE** by David Rowe and
the FreeDV team. SSTVAE applies those ideas to still images; any
mistakes in the translation are mine.

The autoencoder is trained on **[COCO](https://cocodataset.org)**
