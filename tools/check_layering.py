"""Enforce the native tree's layering rules.

docs/native-app.md: *"Enforced by a CI grep, not by good intentions."*
This is that grep, made specific enough to be worth running.

The rules mirror the Python package's, for the same reasons:

* **Nothing under `core/` may include QtWidgets.** The Python package's
  rule was "nothing below sstvae/gui/ may import Qt"; that GUI is gone,
  but the point it protected is not -- the engines stay drivable without
  a GUI, which is what makes headless tests and CLI tools possible at
  all, and `sstvae/rx/`, `sstvae/tx/` and `sstvae/overlay/` are still
  Qt-free for exactly that reason.
* **`core/overlay/` may include QtGui, but not QtWidgets.** Overlay
  rendering has to work under QGuiApplication with an offscreen
  platform, so an overlay stays renderable from the command line. This
  is the C++ restatement of "nothing in sstvae/overlay/ may import Qt".
* **Only `core/audio/qt/` may include Qt Multimedia.** Soundcard I/O is
  the one place in `core/` that needs a Qt module, and it is a separate
  library (`SSTVAE_BUILD_QTAUDIO`) so the modem, the codec and both
  engines still build and test on a machine with no Qt at all. The
  engines take their player and their decoder as seams to keep that
  true; a Qt include anywhere else in `core/` would quietly undo it.
* **Only `core/checkpoint/` may include Qt Network.** The Hub download
  is the one thing in `core/` that needs a network stack, and it is a
  separate library so that resolution and the cache lookup -- which is
  every case but a first run -- stay dependency-free.
* **Nothing outside `bindings/embed/` may link libpython.** The
  dev-only build that embeds the Python modem is the single exception,
  and it is never shipped.
* **`config.hpp` is generated**, so nothing may be hand-edited into it.
  Checked by regenerating; see tools/gen_config_header.py --check.

Run with no arguments to check the whole tree.
