"""Compare the C++ core against the Python reference, side by side.

This is the complement to `pytest --native`. That mode *substitutes* the
C++ implementations and runs the whole suite through them, answering
"does the port satisfy everything we require of the modem?". These tests
instead hold both implementations in one process and diff them
directly, answering "where exactly do they differ, and by how much?" --
which is the question you need answered when the first mode fails.

Skipped entirely when the extension module has not been built, so a
normal `pytest` run is unaffected. Build it with tools/build_native.sh.

The tolerances here are the same ones justified in
native/tests/test_golden.cpp; see that file for why they are not zero.
The short version: both sides now reduce the phasor argument exactly in
integer arithmetic before calling exp(), so the only residual is that no
standard requires a transcendental to be correctly rounded -- about one
ulp. Measured 9.6e-16 on the OFDM matrices, 0 on the pilot sequence.
