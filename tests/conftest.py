"""Clip-relative calibration for latent-SNR assertions.

Most end-to-end tests recover latents and assert a minimum latent SNR.
That SNR has a hard ceiling set by TX clip-and-filter distortion, which
scales with `config.CLIP_HEADROOM_DB` — so hardcoded absolute
thresholds silently encode whatever headroom happened to be configured
when they were written. They were calibrated at 5.0 dB; when the
constant moved to 0.5 dB, 13 tests failed despite the modem being
perfectly healthy. The thresholds were measuring the config, not the
code.

Instead, tests state the cost of the impairment they actually exercise
and compare against the clip floor measured at the *current* config.

Clipping distortion and channel impairments are independent additive
noise sources, so their noise powers add:

    1/SNR_total = 1/SNR_clip + 1/SNR_impairment

Verified against measurements to within 0.25 dB for CLIP_HEADROOM_DB
from 0.5 dB through 30 dB (i.e. from heavy clipping to none at all),
across AWGN, fading, sample-clock offset and frame-erasure impairments.

# --- running the suite against the C++ core --------------------------------
#
# `pytest --native` substitutes the C++ implementations from
# native/bindings/module into the reference modules, so this suite
# becomes the native port's acceptance suite. See docs/native-app.md;
# this is the mechanism the whole parity plan rests on, and it costs the
# table below plus about thirty lines.
#
# Substitution is by attribute assignment on the reference module, which
# is why every binding keeps its Python counterpart's exact signature.
# Two consequences worth knowing:
#
# * A module that did `from .ofdm import pilot_template` bound the
#   function at import time, so patching `ofdm.pilot_template` would not
#   reach it. Those sites are listed explicitly rather than discovered,
#   because a missed one means a test that silently keeps exercising
#   Python while reporting itself as a native run.
# * Module-level arrays (MOD_MATRIX and friends) are substituted too, so
#   the C++ tables are genuinely in the path rather than merely built.
