"""The C++ config reader.

This used to be a two-implementation test: the native reader against
`sstvae.gui.settings.Config`, checking that a `config.json` written by
either app was understood by the other. The Python GUI is gone
(2026-08-01), so there is only one implementation and nothing to
compare it to. What is left is the part that was always the real
content -- a settings reader's bug is a field it accepts and then
quietly drops, and that is checkable without a second implementation.

`NON_DEFAULT` is how: a complete config in which **no field holds its
default**, required to survive a round trip byte for byte. A dropped
field comes back as its default, and no default appears in the fixture,
so it cannot survive. `test_the_fixture_holds_no_default` keeps that
property true as fields are added -- it compares the fixture against the
reader's own defaults key by key, so a *new* setting that nobody added
here fails immediately rather than being silently untested.

Two things outlive the Python app for their own reasons. The v1 rig
section must still **migrate quietly**: the shape changed on 2026-07-29
(it described a rigctld socket -- host, port, spawn_local -- which is
the one part of rig control the native app does not have, since it links
libhamlib in-process), and it is not the operator's fault that their
file is old, so the dead keys are recognized-and-ignored rather than
reported. And the filename templates are checked against **frozen
expected strings** rather than against a second implementation, which
is the stronger form: it pins what the operator sees rather than only
that two pieces of code agree.

The reader also reports what it ignored. Python dropped unknown or
ill-typed keys silently, which is the right *effect* (an old build must
not wipe a new build's settings) but makes a typo in a hand-edited
config invisible. Those notes are tested here, because a diagnostic
nobody checks is a diagnostic that stops being true.
