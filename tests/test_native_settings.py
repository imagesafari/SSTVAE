"""The C++ config reader against the Python one.

Not a parity test in the sense the modem ones are -- exact behaviour is
not required here. What *is* required is that the two apps can share a
machine: a `config.json` written by either must be understood by the
other, with every setting surviving the trip. Anything else is a
silently reverted preference.

**Except the rig section, which diverged deliberately on 2026-07-29**
and is excluded from the shared-config tests by `_shared`. The old
shape described a rigctld socket -- host, port, spawn_local -- which is
the one part of rig control the native app does not have, since it links
libhamlib in-process; and it could not express what a real radio needs
(handshake, forced control lines, PTT on a separate port). The Python
GUI is being deleted at parity, so growing that schema in a module
already scheduled for removal would be churn.

What is still tested about the rig, because it is what an operator
actually experiences: a v1 rig section must *migrate quietly*. It is
not the user's fault that the file changed shape, so an old config must
produce no complaints -- see `test_a_v1_rig_section_migrates_quietly`.

The C++ side adds something the reference does not have: it reports
what it ignored. Python drops unknown or ill-typed keys silently, which
is the right effect (an old build must not wipe a new build's settings)
but makes a typo in a hand-edited config invisible. Those notes are
tested here too, because a diagnostic nobody checks is a diagnostic
that stops being true.
