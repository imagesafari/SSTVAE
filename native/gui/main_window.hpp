// The application window.
//
// **The receive and transmit panels sit side by side in a splitter,
// not in tabs.** The reference (and this port until now) put them in a
// `QTabWidget`, which meant composing a picture was done blind: no
// waterfall, no decode progress, no incoming preview. On the band that
// is the wrong trade -- you prepare the next transmission *while*
// listening, and the thing you most want to see while composing is
// whether someone else is sending.
//
// **The price is the window's minimum width, and it is not small.** A
// `QSplitter`'s minimum is the *sum* of its children's, not the max a
// tab widget got away with, and a collapsed pane still counts because
// it is not hidden. Measured with `sstvae-gui-shot`, which prints each
// pane's `minimumSizeHint`: transmit 545, receive 464, so the window
// floor is ~1015 px against ~738 before. Progress-tier labels are
// therefore set `QSizePolicy::Ignored` wherever they would otherwise
// pin a width -- that alone took transmit from 738 to 545.
//
// **Tabs remain available for a screen that cannot meet that floor**
// (`ui.layout`, View > Layout). Scrolling inside the panes was the
// other candidate and treats the symptom: the floor is a property of
// the arrangement, and only the arrangement can move it. See
// `pane_container.hpp` for the switch and why "auto" measures the
// screen rather than the window.
//
// The wiring between the panels lives here rather than in either of
// them, because all of it is about the pair: half duplex (our own
// transmission must not be decoded back into a received picture),
// pausing frequency polling while keyed, and handing the most recent
// received picture to the transmitter as an overlay inset.
