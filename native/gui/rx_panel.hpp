// Receive panel: waterfall, live picture, and the reception controls.
//
// A port of `sstvae/gui/rx_panel.py`, keeping its threading shape,
// which is the part with the hazards in it:
//
// **The decode loop runs on a plain worker thread and reaches this
// widget only through queued signals.** Nothing here touches a widget
// from the decode thread.
//
// **The sink saves on the decode thread rather than signalling the GUI
// to save.** Writing a PNG is file I/O, and the UI thread must not
// stall on a slow or full disk mid-reception.
//
// **Saving is the sink's job, not the loop's**, because the autosave
// checkbox may mean holding the picture for the Save button instead of
// writing it. Autosave is read through the config at reception time
// rather than captured at start, so toggling it takes effect on the
// very next reception without restarting the loop.
