// Rig control that can never block the thread drawing the window.
//
// The reference was `sstvae/gui/rig_controller.py` (deleted 2026-08-01
// with the Python GUI), but this is a re-derivation rather than a port,
// and `docs/native-app.md` ("Bundling Hamlib") says why: Python talked
// to a `rigctld` child over a socket *because the SWIG Hamlib bindings
// live in the system site-packages and a virtualenv cannot see them*.
// C++ has no such problem, so the constraint that produced that
// architecture is gone. `libhamlib` is linked in-process and the socket
// client, the redial logic, the `rigctld` spawner and the `rigctld -l`
// column parser were never translated.
//
// **The property that survives unchanged is the one that matters**:
// nothing on the GUI thread ever blocks on the rig, and keying is never
// stuck behind a stale poll. Every rig call is blocking I/O that may
// take the rig's full timeout, so:
//
//   * **One backend, owned by one worker thread.** Every operation is a
//     job submitted to it. The handle is touched from nowhere else,
//     which also sidesteps a `RIG*` not being thread-safe.
//   * **PTT is a priority job, and submitting it discards pending
//     polls.** A queued poll is stale by definition -- its answer is a
//     frequency readout. Worst-case keying latency is therefore *one
//     in-flight operation*, never a queue drain. This replaces the
//     reference's separate-PTT-socket trick, which existed to dodge
//     contention that the socket layer itself introduced.
//   * **Polling suspends while transmitting.** The app is already half
//     duplex, so in the normal case PTT contends with nothing at all.
//   * **`stop()` detaches; it never joins.** A worker stuck in a
//     blocking serial read is abandoned, and its exit path owns closing
//     the handle. That is expressed here by the worker co-owning its
//     `Session` through a `shared_ptr`: `stop()` drops the controller's
//     reference, and whichever side is last -- almost always the
//     departing thread -- runs the destructor that closes the backend.
//     Joining would inherit the timeout being escaped.
//   * **A superseded worker cannot publish.** Callbacks hang off the
//     session, and a stopped session's are never invoked, so a reply
//     that arrives after reconfiguration cannot overwrite the new
//     worker's frequency or status. The reference achieves this by
//     passing locals into the thread; same idea, enforced by ownership.
//
// Qt-free, like the rx and tx engines: the GUI adapts the callbacks to
// signals. Blocking calls (`set_ptt`) are for worker threads only --
// `TxEngine` already runs on one.
