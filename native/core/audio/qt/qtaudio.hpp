// Soundcard capture and playback through QtMultimedia.
//
// The thin part. Everything with logic in it -- rate conversion, sample
// format conversion, device matching -- is in `core/audio/audio.hpp`,
// Qt-free and tested against a fake device, because that is where every
// audio bug this project has had actually lived. What is left here is
// device enumeration and moving bytes, which needs hardware to test and
// so is kept as small as possible.
//
// **Why QtMultimedia and not PortAudio** (docs/native-app.md): the
// Python app's worst bug was that its PortAudio callback is a *Python*
// function on the host's realtime thread, so it needs the GIL, and a Qt
// thread painting a 640x480 preview after every decode poll stopped it
// running. On JACK -- a couple of milliseconds of period with nothing
// queued -- the audio was silently skipped: 200-350 samples per poll,
// 5 dB of SNR, a mangled picture, while sync succeeded and every frame
// was reported. PortAudio's blocking API would have fixed it, but
// `stream.read()` corrupts the heap on its JACK backend.
//
// C++ has no GIL, so that specific bug cannot recur here and the choice
// is on merit: `QAudioSource` is pull-based over a buffered QIODevice,
// one fewer native dependency, and `QMediaDevices` gives hot-plug and
// default-change notifications PortAudio does not.
//
// This is an optional library (`SSTVAE_BUILD_QTAUDIO`). The modem, the
// codec and both engines build and test with no Qt present at all --
// the engines take their player as a seam precisely so that stays true.
