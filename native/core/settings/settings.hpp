// Persistent application configuration.
//
// Plain structs over JSON. The schema comes from the Python GUI's
// `settings.py` (deleted 2026-08-01), so a config.json that app wrote
// still loads -- see CONFIG_VERSION for the one section that changed
// shape.
// Two robustness rules carry over from there, both learned from config
// files that ate themselves:
//
//  * **Writes are atomic** (temp file + rename), so losing power or
//    filling the disk mid-save leaves the previous config intact rather
//    than a truncated one.
//  * **Loading never fails.** A corrupt config must not stop the
//    application starting, because the settings dialog is how the
//    operator would fix it.
//
// One deliberate improvement on the reference. Python silently drops
// keys it does not recognise or cannot use; that is the right *effect*
// but it makes a typo in a hand-edited config invisible -- the operator
// changes a value, nothing happens, and nothing says why. `load()`
// returns the same never-failing Config plus a list of notes saying
// exactly what was ignored and what was used instead. Still never
// fatal; just no longer silent.

// What Hamlib needs to talk to a radio.
//
// This section deliberately **breaks compatibility** with the config
// the Python app writes (decided 2026-07-29), and the version bump is
// how a reader finds out. The old shape -- host, port, spawn_local --
// described a *rigctld socket*, which is the one part of rig control
// the native app does not have: it links libhamlib in-process, so there
// is no daemon to address or to start. Hamlib model 2 ("NET rigctl") is
// the rigctld client, so talking to a remote daemon is now a model
// number in the same picker rather than a parallel set of fields.
//
// The rest is modelled on WSJT-X's Radio tab, because that is the set a
// real radio actually needs and the one operators already know. Every
// field maps to a `rig_set_conf` token (see `rig/hamlib.cpp`); the
// enumerated ones use our own lowercase spellings rather than Hamlib's,
// so the config file does not become a place where Hamlib's combo-box
// strings leak into a user's editor.
//
// "default" everywhere means *do not set the token at all* and let the
// backend's own default stand -- which for most rigs is the right
// answer and is why WSJT-X offers it as a distinct choice rather than
// making the user guess 8-N-1.
