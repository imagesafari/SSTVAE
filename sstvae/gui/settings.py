"""Persistent application configuration.

Deliberately plain dataclasses over JSON rather than QSettings: the
config is then readable, diffable, portable between machines, and
loadable by headless code that never starts Qt.

Two robustness rules, both learned from config files that eat
themselves:

* **Writes are atomic** (temp file + os.replace), so losing power or
  hitting a disk-full mid-save leaves the previous config intact rather
  than a truncated one.
* **Unknown keys are ignored, not fatal.** Running an older build
  against a config a newer one wrote must not wipe the operator's
  settings -- worst case a new option reverts to its default.
