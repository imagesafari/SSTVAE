"""Loading the model and turning pictures into latents and back.

The encoder/decoder network *is* the codec, so every tool -- the CLI
scripts, the live listener, the GUI -- needs it. These used to live in
`sstvae_encode.py` / `sstvae_decode.py` at the top level, which meant
anything inside the package that wanted them had to import a *script*.
They live here now; the scripts re-export them so their command lines
and any existing imports are unchanged.

**The runtime backend is ONNX, and torch is for training.** `torch` is
336 MB against `onnxruntime`'s 27 MB and exists here solely to run two
convolutional passes; `docs/onnx.md` has the measurements, including the
result that matters -- fp32 ONNX and torch are the *same codec* to
~2e-06 on unit-RMS latents, about 105 dB below the channel noise. A
station running either decodes the other's transmissions exactly.

The torch backend is still available (`backend="torch"`) as the
reference implementation, and is what `scripts/export_onnx.py` verifies
against. It is not what a receiving station installs.

**Parts load lazily and independently.** Encoding touches only the
encoder; decoding and listening only the decoder. So a receive-only
station never downloads, loads, or pays memory for the encoder -- which
is also why `--model` can accept a single `.onnx` file and still be
unambiguous. See `checkpoint.resolve_onnx`.
