"""Soundcard I/O: device enumeration and stream opening.

Everything here is optional at import time -- `sounddevice` (PortAudio)
is only needed by the live tools, so it is imported inside the functions
rather than at module scope. That keeps `import sstvae.audio` working on
a machine with no PortAudio, which matters because the settings dialog
wants to *report* that rather than fail to start.

The awkward part these helpers exist to hide: SSTVAE runs at 8 kHz, and
plenty of devices refuse that rate outright. PulseAudio and most modern
backends resample transparently, but ALSA hardware devices and some
Windows drivers do not, so both directions fall back to the device's
native rate with polyphase resampling on the way past.

# Host APIs where a Python capture callback is not safe to rely on.
#
# Our PortAudio callback is Python, so it runs on the host's realtime
# audio thread and must take the GIL to do anything at all. Any other
# thread holding the GIL -- the Qt thread converting a 640x480 preview to
# a QPixmap and painting it, right after every decode poll -- stops it
# from running. Hosts with a large software buffer (PulseAudio, PipeWire's
# own device) absorb that invisibly. **JACK does not**: its period is a
# couple of milliseconds with nothing queued behind it, so the audio is
# skipped, silently, with no status flag to report.
#
# Measured on a PipeWire-JACK device: ~200-350 samples lost on every
# decode poll, tracking `poll_interval` exactly (change the interval and
# the losses follow it), costing 5 dB of SNR and a mangled picture, while
# still syncing and reporting every frame received. The identical code was
# clean headless, which is what made it look like a GUI decode bug.
#
# The proper fix is to keep Python off the realtime thread. PortAudio's
# *blocking* API would do that -- its own C callback fills an internal
# ring -- but `stream.read()` **corrupts the heap on the JACK backend**
# (`malloc(): invalid size`) at every blocksize and latency tried, so it
# is not available. The real fix is a capture layer whose realtime side
# is not Python at all; see docs/native-app.md on QtMultimedia.
